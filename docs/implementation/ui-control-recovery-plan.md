# EFCC UI Control Recovery — Ticket-Driven Implementation Tracker

> **Purpose:** Track execution across separate phase sessions without duplicating the Spec or GitHub tickets.  
> **Source of truth:** Parent Spec [#505](https://github.com/Noahlw/efcc/issues/505) and the current GitHub ticket body/comments.  
> **Update rule:** Every phase session reads this file at the start and updates it before ending.  
> **Intended repo path:** Replace the current content of `docs/implementation/ui-control-recovery-plan.md` with this document.

## 1. What this document is — and is not

This document is the **cross-session tracker** for the UI rescue.

It exists so that a new OMP session can answer, quickly:

- Which phase are we in?
- Which ticket is currently eligible?
- What has already merged into the rescue branch?
- What evidence and human approvals already exist?
- What is blocked?
- What is the next safe action?

It is **not**:

- a replacement for the parent Spec;
- a copy of every ticket’s acceptance criteria;
- a second architecture document;
- a place for agents to re-plan or re-slice T01–T36;
- a general repository policy manual.

The GitHub ticket being implemented is always the acceptance-scope authority.

## 2. Stable project references

| Item | Reference |
|---|---|
| Repository | `Noahlw/efcc` |
| Parent Spec | [#505](https://github.com/Noahlw/efcc/issues/505) |
| Frozen Phase F source | `feat/s4-f-contraction-release-gate` |
| Frozen Phase F SHA | `6edf28c0f8f7058cf992416e7b517824c3178c8c` |
| Rescue integration branch | `rescue/ui-control-recovery` |
| Historical stack | PRs #457, #458, #469, #470, #471, #472, #473, #496, #497, #501, #502, #503, #504 |
| Rescue decision | Undecided until T12 / [#517](https://github.com/Noahlw/efcc/issues/517): `SALVAGE STACK` or `SELECTIVE REPLAY` |

### Stable delivery rules

- Never implement directly on the historical Phase F branch.
- Every implementation ticket gets its own branch/worktree and focused PR.
- Every ticket PR targets `rescue/ui-control-recovery`.
- The GitHub issue body and comments define the ticket scope.
- A blocker must be merged into the rescue branch before its dependent ticket starts.
- Tests and `/code-review` must complete before a PR is considered ready.
- A visual ticket is not complete until the required human approval is recorded.
- Do not weaken tests, contracts, baselines, or tolerances to make implementation pass.
- Do not modify or supersede the historical S4 PRs recorded in the ledger before T35/T36.
- Do not use a single phase session to combine several tickets into one PR.

## 3. How each phase session works

### At session start

1. Read root `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read this tracker.
3. Read parent Spec #505.
4. Read the GitHub body and comments for the tickets in the current phase.
5. Verify the phase entry gate and rescue integration HEAD.
6. Select only the first genuinely unblocked ticket.
7. Create a fresh branch/worktree from the latest approved rescue integration HEAD.
8. Update **Current execution state** before editing.

### For each ticket

1. Implement only that ticket.
2. Run its focused and aggregate verification.
3. Invoke `/code-review`.
4. Resolve findings without changing the ticket contract.
5. Prepare the PR with `/pr-description`.
6. For visual tickets, stop at `WAITING_HUMAN` until the owner approves.
7. Merge only after all required gates.
8. Update the ticket row, evidence, merge SHA, and next frontier.

### At session end

1. Update the current phase table.
2. Append a ticket execution log entry.
3. Update human approval and blocker records.
4. Update rescue integration HEAD.
5. Write the phase handoff if the phase is complete.
6. Clear the active ticket fields.
7. Stop. The next phase starts in a new session.

---

## 4. Current execution state

Update this table at the start and end of every implementation session.

| Field | Current value |
|---|---|
| Current phase | **Phase 0 — Foundation & Recovery Control** |
| Phase status | `IN PROGRESS — T01 correction` |
| Rescue integration HEAD | `e68d554e7dd7abb97dfa916ffe861f616b82cc57` — T01 initial ledger merged; correction worktree based here |
| Active ticket | T01 / [#506](https://github.com/Noahlw/efcc/issues/506) — full-S4 provenance correction |
| Active branch/worktree | `rescue/t01-full-s4-lineage` / `/home/ubuntu/efcc-rescue-t01-lineage` |
| Active PR | None — correction PR pending |
| Current frontier | T01 correction [#506](https://github.com/Noahlw/efcc/issues/506) active; T02 [#507](https://github.com/Noahlw/efcc/issues/507) remains independent; T04 [#509](https://github.com/Noahlw/efcc/issues/509) blocked until correction merges |
| Pending human approval | None |
| Active blocker | None |
| Next safe action | Expand the ledger from #473 back through #457/#458/#469/#470/#471/#472 and map each capability to its Phase F seam |
| Last merged rescue SHA | `d71a7ae807e7bd91795d0d0f6ac514074b3cd7e2` |
| Last rollback checkpoint | Frozen Phase F SHA `6edf28c0f8f7058cf992416e7b517824c3178c8` |
| Entry verification | Frozen Phase F ancestry and rescue base verified; initial T01 PR #543 merged at `d71a7ae807e7bd91795d0d0f6ac514074b3cd7e2`; this correction is the sole active Phase 0 worktree; T02 is not active; T04 remains blocked |

> The tracker is committed on `rescue/ui-control-recovery`; the T01 full-lineage correction must merge before T04 starts. Do not merge the historical S4 stack into `main` merely to move this document.

## 17. Blocker and decision log

Only record blockers or decisions that affect more than one ticket or the next phase.

| ID | Type | First seen | Description | Owner ticket / person | Status | Evidence / resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B-001 | Governance | Starting state | Existing blanket layout-CVA rule conflicts with approved semantic-CVA/composition ownership | T02 / #507 | `OPEN` | — |
| B-002 | Verification | Starting state | Four normalized Worker suites are excluded from the required aggregate | T04 / #509 | `OPEN` | — |
| B-003 | Runtime | Phase F | Full Programs/Worker/D1 journey is unreliable | T05 / #510 | `OPEN` | — |
| D-001 | Decision | Planning | `SALVAGE STACK` vs `SELECTIVE REPLAY` remains undecided until Programs tracer evidence | T12 / #517 + owner | `PENDING` | — |
| B-004 | Reconciliation | Starting state | Required `rescue/ui-control-recovery` branch and intended tracker path were absent at session entry | Phase 0 / owner | `RESOLVED` | Rescue branch and tracker bootstrap are committed; branch is based on the frozen Phase F SHA |

Do not create extra implementation work here. If a blocker needs implementation outside an existing ticket, stop and ask the owner whether the tracker/spec must change.

## 18. Phase handoff template

Complete this at the end of each phase so the next phase can start in a fresh session.

### Phase `<number>` handoff

- **Phase:**  
- **Completed tickets:**  
- **Rescue integration SHA:**  
- **What the phase established:**  
- **Machine verification summary:**  
- **Human approvals recorded:**  
- **Preservation changes:**  
- **Contracts/commands introduced or changed:**  
- **Open blockers carried forward:**  
- **Tracker rows updated:**  
- **Next phase:**  
- **First eligible ticket:**  
- **Exact next action:**  
- **Rollback checkpoint:**  

---

## 19. Tracker update boundaries

Agents may update:

- current phase/status;
- ticket status;
- branch, PR, SHA, and evidence links;
- current frontier;
- active ticket;
- blocker state;
- human approval status as supplied by the owner;
- cross-phase asset links;
- phase handoff;
- next safe action.

Agents must not silently change:

- parent Spec scope;
- ticket titles, acceptance criteria, or blocker graph;
- phase membership;
- the rule that each ticket gets its own PR;
- human approval authority;
- historical preservation rules;
- contract/baseline expectations.

A requested change to those items is not a tracker update. It is an owner-approved ticket/spec/contract change.

---

## 20. Next safe action

1. Replace the old overgrown living-plan content with this ticket-driven tracker.
2. Ensure the tracker commit exists on `rescue/ui-control-recovery`.
3. Verify `rescue/ui-control-recovery` is based on frozen Phase F SHA.
4. Start a new **Phase 0** OMP session using the Phase 0 kickoff prompt.
5. Implement the first unblocked ticket only.
